# Simple process to push changes to a forked repo

Let's say I want to push changes to a forked repo, not the original, because the orginal repo has been archived.

1. Fork the forked repo
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Push to your fork
4. Open a PR in your repo, from your branch to the fork 

* Conditions
  * The fork you're pushing to must be public
  * The fork you're pushing to must have PRs enabled (Nobody disables it)

> Github allows PRs between public forks as well as between public repos, so no special permissions are need, knowing the propietary is also not need.
